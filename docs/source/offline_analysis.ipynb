    "\n",
    " <img src='images/SummaryStatistics.png' width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Grand Average Spectrum** : This shows for each data channel the power over different signal frequencies.  This is useful to identify artifacts in the data,  which tend to show up as peaks in the spectrum at different frequencies, e.g. high power below 3Hz indicate movement artifacts, high power at 50/60hz indicates excessive line-noise interference. \n",

This estimation is used by the system to identify when it is confident enough to make a selection and stop a trial early.

In the DecodingCurve plot Perr is shown by colored dots, with red being Yerr=1 and green being Yerr=0.  Thus, if the error estimates are good you should see red dots at the top left (wrong with short trials) and green dots at the bottom right (right with more data).\n",
